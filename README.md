# IrisFlowerClassification
This project demonstrates how to perform Iris flower classification using logistic regression. It uses the well-known Iris dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, to classify three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link:
[Download the Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)

Make sure to place the downloaded CSV file in the project directory.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries and tools:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (for logistic regression)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```shell
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

## Feature Selection

In this project, we manually selected the following features for classification:

Sepal Length
Petal Length
